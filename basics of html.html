            <p>You can just press ctrl+shift+I on your pc and you will see another window on your screen something is written over there if you look at that</p>
            <p>what are those things:</p>
            <ul>
                <p><strong>HTML </strong> Yes that is HTML </p>
                <li><p> <strong>HTML </strong> stands for hyper text markup language </p></li>
                <li><p> <strong>Some basic operations we are going to perform in this is creating a list and writing a paragraph</strong><em>(Don’t worry, I will also share some other best resources which you can use to learn more)</p></li></em>
            </ul>
                
                <p>Open your Notepad although there are other best alternatives for this but for now this is just </p>
            <h3>A Website</h3>
            <img class="hero-img" src="https://web-development-institute.com/sites/default/files/styles/blogs_large_images/public/difference-between-html-css-and-javascript.png?itok=yPI_snpg"><br>
            <p>is made using HTML CSS and Javascript where we use HTML to structure our project no matter what you are creating as long as it is a Website you need html.</p>
            <p>Where we use CSS to add beauty to it and javascript is kind of brain behind it lets just not go there </p>
            <p>Each web page is written in codes and these codes describe the layout, format and content on the page. The most common coding language used to create web pages is HTML. </p>
            <h3>Creating A Website</h3><br>
            <img class="hero-img" src="./images/html-1.PNG">
            <p> As you can see i have written something but when you see carefully i have written every element twice but one is with a slash(/) and these three are most important html tags</p>
            <p><em>what is tags?</em> I am just talking about those elements we use to call them tags in html</p>
            <ul class="param">
                <li>The tags having slash(/) are the closing tags </li>
                <li>&lt;html&gt; and &lt;/html&gt; these are telling the browsers we are not ordinary element we are HTML and everything written inside me is HTML too </li>
                <li>&lt;head&gt; and &lt;/head&gt; this is head tag use to add title of our project and adding CSS and many more things too</li>
                <li>&lt;body&gt; and &lt;/body&gt; Most of our HTML is written inside this body tag </li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3>Title and Paragraph</h3>
           
            <p> &lt;title&gt; and &lt;/title&gt; tag is used to write the tab name for example if you look the name of this tab its Blog | HTML so i write it here inbetween this tags like this &lt;title&gt; Blog | HTML &lt;/title&gt; </p>
            <p>&lt;p&gt; and &lt;/p&gt; this is use to write paragraph you are reading all this i used these tags to write it here about something which you like we use P tag or paragraph tags inside the body tag which will look something like this</p>
            
            <img class="hero-img" src="./images/html-2.PNG">
            <p><strong>Saving the file</strong>while saving the file save the file with .html extension </p>
            <p>For example if i want to save this file as firstwebpage i will save it as firstwebpage.html </p>
            <p>To tell your pc that its a HTML file and use a browser to open it </p>
            <p>Thats all making a list is your homework </p>
            <h3>But i didn't taught you that</h3>
            <p>I know as a Web Developer you should must learn how to google what you want but for now i will be giving you some links which you can use to learn more about tags </p>
